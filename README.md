## Introduction

This game is a canvas study case to make a pong game.

### To play:
You are the user on the left side of the screen. You can play by pressing up and down arrows on the keyboard to move the plate up or down on the screen. Your goal is to catch the ball with the plate and bounce it to the other user.

## CSE 110 - Bug Description

1. Wait until you see a message in the terminal along the lines of "Welcome to Codespaces! You are on a custom image defined in your devcontainer.json file."
2. When the build finishes, run `yarn start` to start the dev server. You should see the web app opening!

### Task description

The scoreboard at the top of the window should update as the player and/or computer earn points. In this branch, the scoreboard is broken and remains at 0-0 even after a point is made. Your task is to identify the code relevant to the bug, and attempt to find a fix.

Hint: the bug should be a **logic error** in one of the core **TypeScript** files.


### To submit:
Run the following commands line by line to commit and push all your changes (or use the sidebar):
```
$ git add .
$ git commit
$ git push
```
