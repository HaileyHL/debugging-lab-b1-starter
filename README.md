## CSE 110 - Bug Description

### Prerequisite
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install the following extensions in VSCode:
  - [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
  - (Optional, but saves you from manually cloning the repo) [GitHub Classroom](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.classroom)


### To run:
1. Click the "Open in VSCode" code at the top of this repo, if you have the extension "GitHub Classroom" installed. Skip to 3.
2. If not, manually clone this repository using `git`.
3. Open the cloned local repository using VSCode
4. You should see a pop-up in the lower right corner prompting you to "reopen in dev container". Click that.
   - If you do not see the pop-up. Press "Ctrl/Command+Shift+P" and type "Dev Container: Reopen in Container" and select that option.
5. Wait for the container to build, which will automatically set up the required dependencies for the project.
6. When the build finishes, run `yarn start` to start the dev server. GLHF : )

### Task description

The scoreboard at the top of the window should update as the player and/or computer earn points. In this branch, the scoreboard is broken and remains at 0-0 even after a point is made. Your task is to identify the code relevant to the bug, and attempt to find a fix.
