# Let's Play PONG

![gif](/src/assets/gifs/pong.gif)

## Introduction

This game is a canvas study case to make games.

## To run:

In your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4SS1S/pong-ts

cd pong-ts

git checkout pong-ts-bug-1

nvm use 16

yarn

yarn start
```

---

## Buggy behavior

The scoreboard at the top of the window should update as the player and/or computer earn points. In this branch, the scoreboard is broken and remains at 0-0 even after a point is made.
